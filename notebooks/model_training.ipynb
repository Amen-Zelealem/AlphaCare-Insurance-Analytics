    "## Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After preprocessing the data and saving it to a CSV file, the next step is to build and evaluate various machine learning models. This section outlines the approach for model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis, ensuring we achieve the best model for predicting insurance claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "The main objectives of this report are to:\n",
    "- Document the complete process of training, evaluating, and interpreting machine learning models for predicting car insurance claims.\n",
    "- Utilize the preprocessed dataset to train various models.\n",
    "- Evaluate each model based on relevant metrics to identify the best-performing one.\n",
    "- Conduct SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to explain feature importance and model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Training Approach\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Load the preprocessed dataset and split it into training and testing sets.\n",
    "2. **Model Selection**: Choose various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).\n",
    "3. **Training**: Fit the models on the training set.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, RÂ², and accuracy.\n",
    "5. **Feature Importance**: Use SHAP analysis to interpret model outputs and understand the impact of different features on predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This comprehensive approach ensures that we not only find the most effective model for predicting insurance claims but also understand the underlying factors that influence these predictions."
